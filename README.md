# Pac-Man Ghost Hunter
## COSC 416 Retro Twist Game Jam

The following game is inspired by the classic Pac-Man game, but adds a twist mechanic of allowing the player to shoot enemies. Similar to the original game, the player collects yellow coins to increase their score, but there are additionally green coins for ammo pickups, and red trap coins which add new enemies to the scene, introducing an extra level of difficulty to the game.

The game ends when the player collects all of the yellow coins in all 3 levels, or when they lose all lives.

The game can be played on [itch.io](https://muesli-joy.itch.io/pac-man-ghost-hunter).
